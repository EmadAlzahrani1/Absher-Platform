# National Resilience Simulation – Java OOP (4R Framework)

This project is a simple Java OOP simulation that demonstrates how a national digital platform (such as **Absher**) can implement the **4 Rs of Resilience**:

1. **Recognition** – Detect the problem  
2. **Resistance** – Reduce the impact  
3. **Recovery** – Restore critical services  
4. **Reinstatement** – Return to full functionality  

The simulation models real-world incidents such as DDoS attacks, database failures, provider outages, and credential theft.  
It shows how resilience allows a national system to continue operating even during failures.
